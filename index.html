				<h1>About</h1>
				<p>This is the introduction to my portfolio project as a software engineering student. I've always been passionate to leverage the power of technology to improve our daily livelihood. Moving around knocking gates and making several calls in search for houses is one of the most tiring activities I've got involved in. Thanks to web development, I'm now developing a platform where house owners can conveniently advertise their buildings whereas tenants get quality and convenient places to stay. <br />This project provides a unique opportunity to sharpen my skills on backed as well as front end development. Whereas the project still focusses on backed, when completed, the front end should be fully developed too. Some of the skills learned so far include <i>Node.js, MySQL, python, Express, Flask, JavaScript, c, bash </i> and many more. Please find the links to my github repositories.</p>
